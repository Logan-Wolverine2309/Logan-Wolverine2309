# Hi there, I'm Jit Mondal! 👋

## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I'm Jit Mondal, a 2025 Computer Science graduate with a strong foundation in **frontend and full-stack development** using **React**, **Vite**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Node.js**.

### 🚀 Key Highlights:

- ⚛️ Built responsive, performant SPAs using **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Material UI (MUI)**.
- 🔧 Hands-on with modern frontend tooling: **Vite**, **Redux**, **React Router**, **MUI**, **Framer Motion**, and more.
- 🤖 Leveraged AI tools like **ChatGPT** and **GitHub Copilot** to streamline workflows, debug code, and boost productivity.
- 🧼 Followed **clean code principles**, structured components smartly, and ensured pixel-perfect design implementation.
- 🌐 Deployed multiple projects using **Vercel** and **Netlify** for blazing-fast hosting.

💡 Outside of development, I explore competitive coding on platforms like [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) and work on UI/UX-based personal projects.

🎯 Currently seeking **Frontend Developer** roles where I can deliver clean, fast, and delightful web experiences.
